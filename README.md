# Simple Screen Recorder â€“ Web-Based

A lightweight, no-nonsense screen recording tool built for ease of use.

## Purpose

This project was born out of a practical need: my mom needed a way to screen record her computer so I could assist her remotely. Most tools out there were bloated, confusing, or required installation. This tool aims to solve that with a simple interface focused on usability.

## Features

- Record specific windows, tabs, or full screen
- Works across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- No installation or setup required
- Clean UI with only essential controls: **Start**, **Stop**, and **Download**
- Privacy-focused: recordings are stored locally and never leave your device

## Use Case

Designed for non-technical users or anyone needing a quick, reliable way to capture screen activity without the overhead of complex software.

## How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Click **Start Recording**
3. Choose the window, tab, or screen you want to capture
4. When finished, click **Stop**
5. The video will be available to download immediately
